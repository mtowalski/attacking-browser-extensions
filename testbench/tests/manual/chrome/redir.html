<h1>Redirect to chrome-extension:// URIs of Apps</h1>
<p>
    A 302 redirect can not only redirect to an Extension's
    chrome-extension://-URL, it can navigate to URLs of Chrome Apps, too. This
    is a manual test since there have to be special circumstances given for this
    to work. First and foremost, the link has to be loaded in a fresh tab which
    is why a link with target="_blank" works perfectly. Secondly there are heavy
    restrictions on the URL making connecting back for telling the test runner
    the result very hard.
