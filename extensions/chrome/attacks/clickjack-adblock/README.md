AdBlock Clickjacking Attack
===========================
Performs a Bait & Switch type Clickjacking attack on the AdBlock Chrome
extension. See the thesis for more information.

In order to work correctly, this attack requires you to open it from a
file:///-URI. Alternatively, the 302 redirect bug can be used to mount the
attack from web content.
